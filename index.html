            Hi,
            I am a Los-Angeles based artist.
            I practice different types of art, ranging from digital to traditional.
            I graduated with a BA in illustration at Art Center College of Design.
            I have been working as an art director and a sketch artist and illustrator
            at various advertising agencies.
            <br>
            <br>

            I am taking this coding class to boost my skills in creative softwares.
            The codes I learn for web development will also add to my toolbox for my advertising career as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have attended many art schools after I graduated from Art Center to practice different types of art
            that are within the entertainment field and marketing for entertainment.
            I find web development a crucial component of marketing as technology has transformed the means of the print media
            to digital media. That is why I am taking this class.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am very happy with what I have learned so far, and I can see the possibilities of the application of what I am learning from this class already.
           <br>
            This is very exciting and I look forward to learning more!
        
            <br>
